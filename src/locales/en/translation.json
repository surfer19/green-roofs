      "header": "What is a <0>Green roof?</0>",
      "description": "<0>A Green roof</0> is a term used for building with a green canopy - roof covered in vegetation. Green roofs have multiple advantages for the building, because the <0> absorb rainwater, provide insulation, create a habitat for wildlife, etc. </0> But mainly it genuinely helps to <0>lower urban air temperature</0> and mitigate the heat island effect."

      "par1": "Our proof of concept about green roofs in Prague was based on data and analysis prepared by the <0> ICT Data Platform Operator.</0> For more info click <1>here</1>.",
      "par2": "In general, the statistics show that under ideal conditions, up to <0> 1,659 ha of green roofs</0> could be installed <0> just in Prague, Czech Republic.</0>"

      "description1": "On the map, you can see <0> 1050 buildings</0> in the center of Prague, which can be converted into green roofs. The analysis divides them into <0> 4 categories </0> according to the following criteria - area, owner, surface, climb.",
      "description2": "On this map, there are <0> 45 buildings in category 1 </0> (the most suitable roof for green roof) that met the criteria.",
      "description3": "<0>But are those buildings really the ones with a negative impact on the environment?</0>"

      "description": "We took a temperature map from the Landsat 8 satellite, which helped us to <0> detect buildings in the worst areas </0> of the center of Prague. The strong red color indicates a high temperature in the area. <0> We selected two areas with the biggest heat and they show 92 roofs in total.</0>"

      "description": " If the city does not have enough money to convert 92 roofs into green roofs, we can select an even narrower selection of roofs - the following map shows <0> 21 buildings </0> in the area that belong only to <0> Category 1 or Category 2. </0>"
    },
    "conclusion": "After converting these roofs to green-roofs, we can detect whether <0> the temperature map has improved in the given areas,</0> which can positively affect the lives of people in Prague."
